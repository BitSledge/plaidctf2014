Silly and kind of crazy web problem:
we host a server (MUST HAVE IPv6 ADDRESS)
ideally with an smtp server installed as well

to setup: host the to_host folder, as well as the source.tar file
initialize the database with database.sql

Source is given (linked to on the page)
goal is SQL injection, to read the flag column from the flag table

the vuln:
when resetting an account, the information on the client is saved.
this information includes dns_get_record of the reverse dns of the host
the host is mysql escaped, but not the dns record
putting sql injection in the txt record of the host allows sql injection

The method I used to do this:
create an ipv6 tunnel account at hurricane electric
they let you specify reverse dns information. point reverse dns of your
ip to secret3.copyfighter.org

this has a txt entry of "*/', email=(select flag from flag), resetinfo='/*"

this will set the email of the user to the result of that select query
the comments are needed because the way the dns information is stored
(and printed to the user in email, for helpful debugging :P)
it is repeated, so the comments make it count only one time

then you reset the password a second time, which will print the
email address of the account

(at first I used the username field, but the database requires this to
be unique so it failed... contestants will be able to see this, because
trying to register an account that already exists will simply print out the
error)
